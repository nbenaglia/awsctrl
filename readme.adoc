AWS Controller is Kubernetes controller manager which contains controllers that manage AWS resources using link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/[custom resource definitions (CRDs)].

== Features

* Kubernetes Native; _using CRDs_
* 100% Open Source
* Infrastructure as Configuration

== Overview

The AWS Controller is an open source Kubernetes native application that runs in your Kubernetes cluster and listens to the Kubernetes API Server for AWS related https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom Resources]. These custom resources allow you to create external Cloud Native resources like https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon S3 Buckets], https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/[AWS ECR Repositories], and many more. 

By using the AWS Controller you enable a streamlined experience to deploying your Cloud Native applications on AWS. No longer do you need to manage complex deployment pipelines or manage separate deployment tools for infrastructure as you do your application. Now you can deploy everything using `kubectl apply -f`.
